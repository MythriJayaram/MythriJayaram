### Hi there 👋, Mythri here!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Data & AI Engineer / Applied ML Engineer with experience in building production-grade data platforms, ML systems and full-stack AI applications in cloud environments. I work across the stack from data ingestion and model development to APIs, dashboard and user-facing AI tools with a strong focus on scalability, reliability and real-world impact.

Skills:  Python / SQL / AWS / Databricks / ML Pipelines / APIs / Docker / CI/CD / React / Streamlit

🔧 What I Work On
	•	Building end-to-end data & ML pipelines (ingestion → modeling → deployment)
	•	Developing AI/ML-powered backend services and REST APIs
	•	Creating full-stack analytics & AI applications with interactive UIs
	•	Integrating LLMs, NLP models and AI services into products
	•	Ensuring data quality, monitoring and system reliability in production

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building AI-driven workflows and ML pipelines used in live environments. Developing full-stack AI applications with APIs and dashboards. Evaluating model performance, latency, and reliability in production systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R & Julia Programming language 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects focused on data analysis, machine learning, or any innovative use of statistical models. 
- 😄 Pronouns: (She/Her) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving complex data puzzles and often find myself lost in hours of coding to uncover hidden insights
